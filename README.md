# Project Title: Employee and Company Management System using Django Framework

## Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to develop a web-based application using the Django framework that allows users to manage employee and company data. The application will include CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on Employee and Company models, which will be accessible through an admin-style browsable interface.

The application will have two types of users: regular users and admin users. Regular users will be able to perform GET operations and view employee and company data in JSON format only. Admin users will have access to all CRUD operations and will be able to create, update, and delete records.

The Employee and Company models will have the following attributes:

The application will allow users to view a list of all employees and companies, as well as search for employees of a particular company. The search function will allow users to filter employees by company name or by any other attribute of the Employee model.

The application will be developed using Django's built-in authentication system to provide secure access to the admin interface. The admin interface will allow admin users to manage user accounts, as well as perform CRUD operations on employee and company records.

Overall, the Employee and Company Management System will be a user-friendly and efficient tool for managing employee and company data, while providing the necessary security and access controls for different user roles.
